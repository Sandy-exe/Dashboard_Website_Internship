Sql commands for analysis
1) select (sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connected))*100 as percentage from main group by month(BAR GRAPH)

query:

CREATE TABLE Connect_by_Month AS
SELECT Month, (COUNT(*) / (SELECT SUM(allocation) FROM card_data)) * 100 as Percentage
FROM main
WHERE callstatus = 'Connected'
GROUP BY Month;

2) select (sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connected))*100 as percentage from main group by zone (BAR GRAPH)

query:
CREATE TABLE Connect_by_Zone AS
SELECT Zone, (COUNT(*) / (SELECT SUM(allocation) FROM card_data)) * 100 as Percentage
FROM main
WHERE callstatus = 'Connected'
GROUP BY Zone;


3) select (sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connect))*100 as percentage,(sum(notconnect)/sum(connected+notconnected))*100 as percentage from main(BAR GRAPH)

query:



4) select sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connected) as percentage from main group by acc status (LINE GRAPH)

query:


5) select sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connected) as percentage from main group by acc language(LINE GRAPH)

query:

6) select sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connected) as percentage,sum(attempt)/sum(not attempted+attempt) as percentage1 from main group by acc status(BAR)

query:

7) select sum(connect)/sum(not connected+connected) as percentage,sum(attempt)/sum(not attempted+attempt) as percentage1 from main group by CALL status(BAR)

query:


for cards
1) allocation/volume (12467521)
2) Connect % (64.8649)(8087041/allocation)
3) paid count (10445761)
4) resolution (paidcount/connected)%  
5) Avg attempt intensity sum(noofattempts)/count(account)=17.972973
6) Avg connect intensity sum(noofconnects)/count(account)=2.837837






Future Configurations:
1) view and change data in admin
2) if i use database alone...filter option is not possible is very slow (possible solution is to create intermediate database for 
required data alone and update it from server side or sampling)
3) if i use csv alone(with python)...filter option is possible but not secure (solution: create a python file to just to store 
hard coded csv pandas dataframe to use from there)
4) using indexing is an option???

# Armsoftech Internship Project

## About
At Armsoftech, I crafted a dynamic Django-based dashboard for client access during my internship. It includes seamless PowerBI integration for advanced data analytics. Advanced Django techniques were employed, along with AJAX for dynamic changes.

## Database
- Utilized SQLite during development for efficient local data storage and management.
- Integrated MySQL for robust and scalable data handling in production environments.

## PowerBI Integration
After publishing, integrated PowerBI frames to enable advanced data analytics and visualization within the dashboard, enhancing user experience and decision-making capabilities.
